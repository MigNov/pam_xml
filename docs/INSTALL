PAM XML MODULE INSTALLATION
===========================

To install PAM XML module to your system you have to compile the pam_xml.so library and
put the library to /usr/lib/security on i386 systems or /usr/lib64/security on x86_64
systems.

After copying the pam_xml.so library, modifications of appropriate file in the /etc/pam.d
directory is necessary.

To the beginning of the file prepend pam_xml.so library line right after pam_env line, e.g.:

        auth        required      pam_env.so
	auth        sufficient    pam_xml.so algo=sha256 ruleset=/etc/pam.rules/example.xml
        auth        required      pam_deny.so

The "ruleset=" argument defines the path to PAM XML definition file. 

    The supported arguments are:

        "logfile" to save a log file (must be a local file, usually in /tmp)
        "algo" to specify password hashing algorithm, can be one of following:
             "none"/"disable" to disable hashing - password WILL be in plain text
             "md5" to hash using MD5 function
             "sha1" to hash using SHA-1 function
             "sha256" to hash using SHA-256 function
        "ruleset" to specify location of ruleset XML file, can be either local file or any location that can accepted
              by libcurl library. For CURL downloads the User-Agent is set to "PAM-XML Authentication Service/" with
              VERSION string appended.
        "envruleset" to enable setting up PAM_XML_RULESET environment variable, useful for debugging purposes when
              you use multiple PAM-XML definition files.

    Usually it is a good practice to set algorithm to SHA256 and verify User-Agent in case of HTTP-based ruleset
    files (see pam-test.php in data directory for example).
