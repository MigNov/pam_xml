PAM XML MODULE INSTALLATION
===========================

To install PAM XML module to your system you have to compile the pam_xml.so library and
put the library to /usr/lib/security on i386 systems or /usr/lib64/security on x86_64
systems.

After copying the pam_xml.so library, modifications of appropriate file in the /etc/pam.d
directory is necessary.

To the beginning of the file prepend pam_xml.so library line right after pam_env line, e.g.:

        auth        required      pam_env.so
        auth        sufficient    pam_xml.so file=/etc/pam.xml/example.xml
        auth        required      pam_deny.so

The "file=" argument defines the path to PAM XML definition file.
