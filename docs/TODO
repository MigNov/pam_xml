PAM-XML TODO LIST
=================

There is a list of some features to be implemented:

- MySQL database connection (requires DB Connection specification and query specification)
- PgSQL database connection (dtto)
- Binary file run with specifications how to pass (\n like to mod_ext_auth modules, or command line arguments)
- Setting up variables for shell ?

SSH Key authentication overrides all PAM rules, not applicable for this type. Alternative is to append following
lines to /etc/bashrc:

tail -n 100 /var/log/secure | grep "publickey" | grep $(date | awk '{split($0, a, " "); print a[4]}') > /dev/null 2>&1
if [ "$?" -eq 0 ]; then
        export LOGTYPE="KeyAuth"
else
        export LOGTYPE="Password"
fi

And check for LOGTYPE="KeyAuth" - this one could be handled a different way.
